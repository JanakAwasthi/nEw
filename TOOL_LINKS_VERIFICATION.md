# Tool Links Verification Summary

## Task: Update Homepage Tool Links to Open in Same Tab

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED (Already Correct)

### Findings:
After thorough analysis of the homepage (`index.html`), all tool links are already configured correctly:

#### Navigation Dropdown Links:
- All tool links in the navigation dropdown menus do NOT have `target="_blank"` attributes
- This means they open in the same tab by default (correct behavior)

#### Main Tool Cards Links:
- All tool links in the main content area do NOT have `target="_blank"` attributes
- This means they open in the same tab by default (correct behavior)

#### External Links:
- Only the WhatsApp contact link has `target="_blank"` (line 916)
- This is correct behavior for external links that should open in new tabs

### Tool Links Verified:
✅ Image Tools (dropdown & cards): image-compressor, image-enhancer, image-resizer, image-format-converter, id-photo-maker, etc.
✅ Document Tools (dropdown & cards): photo-to-pdf, pdf-merger, document-scanner, digital-signature, etc.
✅ QR Utilities (dropdown & cards): qr-generator, qr-scanner
✅ Text Tools (cards): store-text
✅ All other tool categories

### Conclusion:
No changes needed - all tool links already open in the same tab as requested. The homepage is correctly configured.

### Total Links Checked: 40+ tool links
### Links with target="_blank": 1 (WhatsApp - correctly external)
### Links opening in same tab: All tool links ✅
